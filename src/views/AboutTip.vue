    <v-text class="text-dark">The Technological Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P.) is one of the countryâ€™s premier
    technological, engineering, and computing higher educational institutions.
    It is a private non-sectarian stock school founded on February 8, 1962 by a group of educators headed by Engineer
    Demetrio A. Quirino, Jr. and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino. Using an outcomes-based educational model with its locally
    and globally accredited programs, T.I.P. allows students to acquire industry-desired qualities and essential
    experiences that better equip them to be effective as soon as they enter the workforce or set up their own
    business.</v-text>
